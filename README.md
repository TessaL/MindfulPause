# MindfulPause
This is a Chrome extension that reminds you to take a 5-second break after you've spent an hour on social media sites.

# FAQ

## 1. How can test the extension on my computer?
Please see https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2714278?hl=en and follow Step 2.

## 2. How do I customize the sites I want to pause?
Once you've downloaded the code, go to https://github.com/TessaL/MindfulPause/blob/main/manifest.json. Inside `"matches"` section, you can add or remove any sites you would like.

## 3. There are many "site blockers" already, what's different with this one?
Great question. There are many existing site blockers that try to make people stay productive by simply blocking out the time-wasting "bad sites"(Facebook. Twitter etc) once you've spent x minutes on them.

Good idea on paper. But I've noticed that they don't work very well. 

Why? Because 1. as a user, you might actually be using the site for meaningful stuff (catching up with a friend on Facebook Messager? Sounds perfectly healthy to me!) and 2. people tend to get frustated by completely blocked from doing something. It feels punitive. It's behavior-changing based on shame. It's not sustainable. And people end up disable/uninstalling the plugins all together and get back to their old habits.

The philosolophy behind MindfulPause is that, instead of just kicking you off of whatever "time-wasting" sites you are on, we want you to get out of your auto-piloting mode. Take a break. Breathe for 5 seconds. That short break is enough for you to catch yourself from mindless browsing. If you're actually using the "bad sites" for valid reasons, you can skip the break and continue what you were doing.

Tools aren't good or bad inherently. Take a breath, and carry on.

## 4. Will this extension be on Chrome store eventually?
I fully intend to. It takes time for Chrome to review and approve extensions.

## 5. What's your next step for this extension?
There are many directions to go to. Sky is the limit. ðŸ™‚

## 6. I want to help. How do I get involved?
