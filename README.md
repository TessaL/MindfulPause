# MindfulPause
This is a Chrome plugin that reminds you to take a 5-second break after you've spent an hour on social media sites.

The existing ite blockers aim to help people reduce time wasted on non-important sites simply block out the "bad sites". 

Good idea on paper. But I've noticed that they don't work very well. 

Why? 

Because 1. you might actually be using the site for meaningful stuff (catching up with a friend on Facebook Messager? Sounds perfectly healthy to me!) and 2. people tend to get frustated by completely blocked from doing something. It feels punitive. It's behavior-changing based on shame. Which doesn't work. And people end up disable/uninstalling the plugins all together.

The philosolophy behind MindfulPause is that, instead of just kicking you off of whatever "time-wasting" sites you are on, we want you to take a break. Breathe for 5 seconds. That short break is enough for you to catch yourself from mindless browsing. If you're actually using the sites for valid reasons, you can skip the break and continue what you were doing.

No tools are bad inherently. Just take a breath, and carry on.
